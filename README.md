# Hello, I'm an Undergrad Exploring Networks and AI! üëã | Ol√°, sou o Caio! üëã

I'm currently an undergraduate student delving into the fascinating realms of Networks and Systems. My interests have recently navigated towards the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Networks, and I am particularly curious about how systems interact and communicate within networks.

Atualmente, sou estudante de Redes e Sistemas, explorando o fascinante mundo de Intelig√™ncia Artificial e Redes. Tenho muita curiosidade sobre como os sistemas interagem e se comunicam dentro das redes.

## Projects :computer | Meus Projetos üõ†Ô∏è:
- **[Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon](https://github.com/caiogimenes/six-degrees)**: Implemented algorithms to solve the classical problem of finding the shortest path of connectivity between actors through the movies they've appeared in.
- **[Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/caiogimenes/tictactoe)** - A simple yet engaging Tic Tac Toe game.
- **[Knights and Knaves](https://github.com/caiogimenes/knights-and-knaves)**: A logical puzzle solved using AI.


## Interests :zap:
- **Open-Source Contribution**: I'm inspired by the collaborative nature of open-source projects, especially within the Linux ecosystem.
- **Academic Exploration**: Being early in my academic journey, I am thrilled about the immense learning that lies ahead.
