# Hello, I'm an Undergrad Exploring Networks and AI! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently an undergraduate student delving into the fascinating realms of Networks and Systems. My interests have recently navigated towards the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Networks, and I am particularly curious about how systems interact and communicate within networks.

## Projects :computer:
- **[Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon](https://github.com/caiogimenes/six-degrees)**: Implemented algorithms to solve the classical problem of finding the shortest path of connectivity between actors through the movies they've appeared in.
- **[Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/caiogimenes/tictactoe)** - A simple yet engaging Tic Tac Toe game.
- **[Knights and Knaves](https://github.com/caiogimenes/knights-and-knaves)**: A logical puzzle solved using AI.


## Interests :zap:
- **Open-Source Contribution**: I'm inspired by the collaborative nature of open-source projects, especially within the Linux ecosystem.
- **Academic Exploration**: Being early in my academic journey, I am thrilled about the immense learning that lies ahead.
